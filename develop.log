理想的途径【充分展示 本群的强大之处】：
1. evaluate current solutions and know what they are doing (and the competitors are doing, [let's enhance io] [topaz solutions] etc., can be provided by the Picsart team)
2. provide a model that is much better than the current solution
3. share the solution at some point of time
